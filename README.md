  Gatsby's Tailwind Landing Starter
</h1>

A simple Landing page built with Tailwind & Gatsby.

_Initial Design by Creative Tim. For complete project and other pages check [tailwind-starter-kit](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/tailwind-starter-kit)._

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the tailwind-landing starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using this starter
    gatsby new tailwind-landing https://github.com/skapavarapu/gatsby-starter-tailwind-landing
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd tailwind-landing/
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!.

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `tailwind-landing` directory in code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save changes and the browser will update in real time!

4.  **Before building production builds turn on purging of unused CSS.**

    Update tailwind.config.js to enable purging.

    ```shell
    purge: {
       enabled: true,
    }
    ```

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── static
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── tailwind.config.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of site (what you see in the browser) such as site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

6.  **`tailwind.config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Tailwind CSS. (Check out the [config docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration/) for more detail).

7.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

8.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of npm dependencies that were installed for project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

9.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for project.

10. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about project.
